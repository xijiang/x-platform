** File pgsnp.cpp
*** Description
    - This is the main file for simulating the ideal population
    - It uses constant population size.
    - The parameters needed are:
      + The constant effective pupulation size
      + Chromosome length in Morgan
      + Number of generations for random mating
      + Mutation rate /meiosis/10^8 base pair
    - Results are written to the standard output, which can be redirected.
